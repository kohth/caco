Cartographers' Companion App (CaCo)
=================

A companion app for marking a map and counting scores in the game Cartographers. This app is intended to be used alongside a physical copy of the game.

CaCo is fanmade and is in no way associated with Thunderworks Games

Introduction
-----------
Cartographers is a flip and write game where you aim to place your polyomino (tetris-like) tile placements to maximize points according to drawn goals. I learnt of this game through [Happy Meeple][0] and really enjoyed it. What barred me from purchasing the physical game was that at this point I had been spoilt by the automatic score counting and that there wasn't a need to physically draw maps every time. Cartographers has an app but the app, as far as I know, is self-contained (no need for the physical copy) and also not multiplayer. So I thought, why not make my own app to do this? And here we are.<sup>1</sup> 

<sup>1</sup> Footnote no one asked for: This sentence makes it sound like it was easy for me but really it was a bigger small project than I thought. I thought it would be as easy as making a calculator. *SPOILER ALERT* It was not.

<sup>2</sup> Footnote that wasn't even referenced in the main text: After making the app I did purchase a physical copy of the game.
